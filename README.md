# Six-Degrees-of-Wikipedia

Hi reader! 

This is an overview of the Six Degrees of Wikipedia project I've been working on since June 2023. 

### OBJECTIVE
Inspired by the proper [Six Degrees of Wikipedia](https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/) website, this program seeks to find the answer to the task at hand...
*what is the longest optimal Wikipedia path?*
This program utilizes basic Graph Theory, optimizations including hash tables and integer comparisons, and data wrangling to improve runtime, sustainability, and efficiency.
